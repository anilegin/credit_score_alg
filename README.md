# credit_score_alg
In the project, we will build a credit scoring algorithm predicting the probability that  somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years. The goal of this project is to build  a model that loan providers can use to help borrowers make the best financial decisions. The detailed explanation of different approaches and experiments can be found inside the notebook.
